Hey There! This is my submission for the assignment.


<h2>PDF Invoice Similarity Matcher 📄🔍</h2>
Hey there! Welcome to the PDF Invoice Similarity Matcher. This nifty little tool helps you find similar invoices in a bunch of PDF files. It's like having a super-smart assistant that can quickly tell you which invoices look alike. Cool, right?</break>

<h3>What Does It Do? 🤔</h3>
Imagine you have a drawer full of invoices (but in this case, they're PDF files on your computer). This tool:

1. Reads all these PDF invoices
2. Figures out what's important in each one
3. When you give it a new invoice, it tells you which ones in your collection are most similar
