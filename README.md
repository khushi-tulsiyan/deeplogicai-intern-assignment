Hey There! This is my submission for the assignment.
PDF Invoice Similarity Matcher 📄🔍
Hey there! Welcome to the PDF Invoice Similarity Matcher. This nifty little tool helps you find similar invoices in a bunch of PDF files. It's like having a super-smart assistant that can quickly tell you which invoices look alike. Cool, right?
What Does It Do? 🤔
Imagine you have a drawer full of invoices (but in this case, they're PDF files on your computer). This tool:

Reads all these PDF invoices
Figures out what's important in each one
When you give it a new invoice, it tells you which ones in your collection are most similar

It's like playing a game of "find the matching invoice," but the computer does all the hard work for you!
